# Architecture Document: AI-Powered Resume Builder

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the proposed technical architecture for the AI-Powered Resume Builder. The architecture is designed to be scalable, secure, and maintainable, leveraging modern cloud technologies and a microservices-based approach to support a growing user base and feature set.

## 2. Architectural Style
A **Microservices Architecture** will be adopted. This choice allows for better scalability, flexibility, and easier maintenance. Each service will be independently deployable and responsible for a specific business capability.

## 3. System Components

### **Frontend (Client-Side)**
*   **Framework:** **React.js** or **Vue.js**. These frameworks are ideal for building dynamic, responsive, and component-based user interfaces.
*   **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** or **Styled-Components** for a modern, utility-first styling approach.
*   **Animations:** **Framer Motion** or **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** to implement the parallax effect and other UI animations.
*   **State Management:** Redux Toolkit or Vuex.

### **Backend (Server-Side)**
The backend will be composed of several microservices communicating via a RESTful API or GraphQL.

*   **API Gateway:** A central entry point for all client requests. It will handle routing, authentication, and rate limiting. (e.g., Amazon API Gateway, NGINX).
*   **User Service:** Manages user authentication, profiles, and subscription status.
    *   **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
    *   **Framework:** Node.js (Express/NestJS) or Python (Django/FastAPI).
*   **Resume Service:** Handles the core logic of creating, storing, updating, and managing resume data.
    *   **Database:** MongoDB is a good choice for storing flexible, JSON-like resume documents.
*   **AI/NLP Service:** The core of the intelligent features. This service will integrate with third-party AI models.
    *   **Technology:** Python is the language of choice due to its extensive AI/ML libraries.
    *   **APIs:** Integration with **OpenAI's GPT API** (or similar LLMs) for content generation, summarization, and analysis.
*   **PDF Generation Service:** A dedicated service to convert resume data (HTML/JSON) into a pixel-perfect PDF document.
    *   **Technology:** A headless browser solution like **Puppeteer** or a library like `pdf-lib`.
*   **Payment Service:** Integrates with a payment gateway to handle subscriptions.
    *   **Provider:** **Stripe** or **Braintree**.

### **Database**
*   A combination of **PostgreSQL** for relational data (users, subscriptions) and **MongoDB** for unstructured data (resume content) is recommended.
*   **Amazon RDS** for PostgreSQL and **MongoDB Atlas** for a managed database experience.

## 4. Cloud & DevOps
*   **Cloud Provider:** **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is recommended for its comprehensive suite of services.
*   **Containerization:** **Docker** will be used to containerize each microservice.
*   **Orchestration:** **Kubernetes (Amazon EKS)** will be used to manage and scale the containerized applications.
*   **CI/CD:** **GitHub Actions** or **Jenkins** for automating the build, test, and deployment pipeline.
*   **Object Storage:** **Amazon S3** for storing user-uploaded assets and generated PDFs.
*   **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** **Amazon CloudFront** to cache and serve frontend assets and media globally for faster load times.

## 5. Security
*   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for securing APIs.
*   **Data:** All data in transit will be encrypted using TLS. Data at rest will be encrypted.
*   **Compliance:** Adherence to GDPR and other privacy regulations is crucial.
*   **Payment:** PCI compliance will be handled by the chosen payment provider (Stripe).
